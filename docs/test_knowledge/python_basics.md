# Python Programming Basics

## Introduction
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.

## Core Concepts

### Variables and Data Types
Python is dynamically typed.
- Integers: `x = 5`
- Strings: `name = "Alice"`
- Lists: `items = [1, 2, 3]`

### Control Structures
#### If-Else
```python
if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
else:
    print("Non-positive")
```

#### Looping
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

## Functions
Defined using the `def` keyword.
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```
