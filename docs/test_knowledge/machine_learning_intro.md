# Introduction to Machine Learning

## Overview
Machine Learning (ML) is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that 'learn', that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks.

## Main Categories

### 1. Supervised Learning
The algorithm learns from labeled training data, helping you predict outcomes for unforeseen data.
*   **Examples**: Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
The algorithm learns from unlabeled data, finding hidden patterns or intrinsic structures.
*   **Examples**: K-means clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
Agents take actions in an environment to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.

## Common Libraries
*   Scikit-learn
*   TensorFlow
*   PyTorch
