### IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

*   *Examples*: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine.

### PaaS (Platform as a Service)
Provides hardware and software tools over the internet (usually for application development).
*   *Examples*: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, Google App Engine.

### SaaS (Software as a Service)
Software that is available via a third-party over the internet.
